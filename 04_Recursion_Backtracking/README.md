# Unit 04: Recursion & Backtracking

## Overview
This unit focuses on mastering **recursion** and **backtracking**, two fundamental techniques used in problems involving exhaustive search, decision trees, and combinatorial generation.

---

## Topics Covered
- Recursive function structure
- Base case and recursive case design
- Backtracking framework
- Decision tree exploration
- State rollback (choose → explore → unchoose)

---

## Key Patterns Learned
- Subset generation
- Permutation generation
- Combination-based recursion
- Constraint-based recursion
- Pruning invalid paths early

---

## Implemented Problems
