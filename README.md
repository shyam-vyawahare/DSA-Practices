# 📘 DSA Practice Repository (Python)

## Overview
This repository is a structured and continuously evolving collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice problems, focused on building strong problem-solving skills and interview-ready algorithmic thinking.

The goal of this repository is not just to solve problems, but to **understand patterns, optimize solutions, and write clean, readable, and scalable code**. Each solution emphasizes clarity of logic, efficiency, and correct handling of edge cases—key skills expected in technical interviews.

Solutions are primarily implemented in **Python**, allowing faster iteration and greater focus on algorithm design rather than language verbosity. The repository follows a **topic-wise and pattern-based approach**, ensuring systematic learning and easy revision.

## Repository Structure
Problems are organized by core DSA topics:

## DSA File structure
DSA-Practice/
├── Python Fundamentals
├── Arrays & Strings
├── Hashing
├── Two Pointers
├── Recursion & Backtracking
├── Linked Lists
├── Stacks & Queues
├── Trees
├── Heaps
├── Graphs
├── Greedy Algorithms
├── Dynamic Programming
├── Notes
├── progress.md
├── problems
└── README.md


Each topic folder contains:
- Well-structured Python solutions
- Clear problem statements
- Optimal approaches with complexity considerations

---

## Learning Approach
This repository follows a **pattern-oriented learning strategy**, where common techniques such as:
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Hash Map lookups
- DFS / BFS
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (Memoization & Tabulation)

are practiced repeatedly across different problem variations to build strong intuition and consistency under interview conditions.

---

## Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A daily DSA practice log
- A revision resource for technical interviews
- A reference library of standard problem-solving patterns
- Proof of consistent learning and discipline

Problems are sourced from well-known competitive programming and interview platforms such as LeetCode and HackerRank, ensuring relevance to real-world hiring scenarios.

---

## Progress Tracking
Progress is tracked in the `progress.md` file to maintain accountability and measure consistency over time.

---

## Ongoing Development
This repository will continue to grow with new problems, optimizations, and refinements, reflecting a long-term commitment to technical excellence, problem-solving mastery, and career readiness.
