# Unit 02: Hashing

## Overview
This unit focuses on mastering **hash-based data structures** to optimize brute-force solutions and achieve constant-time lookups. Hashing is one of the most powerful techniques in DSA and is heavily tested in technical interviews.

All implementations are written in **Python**, emphasizing clarity, optimal complexity, and interview-ready explanations.

## Topics Covered
- Hash maps (`dict`)
- Hash sets (`set`)
- Frequency counting
- Prefix sum with hashing
- Lookup-based optimization
- Eliminating nested loops using hashing

---

## Key Patterns Learned
- Frequency maps
- Seen / visited tracking
- Complement lookup
- Prefix sum hashing
- Set-based sequence detection

---

## Implemented Problems
- Valid Anagram
- Contains Duplicate
- First Unique Character in a String
- Intersection of Two Arrays
- Subarray Sum Equals K
- Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Learning Outcome
After completing this unit, one should be able to:
- Instinctively use hashing to optimize solutions
- Reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)
- Combine hashing with other techniques like prefix sums
- Clearly explain trade-offs in interviews
