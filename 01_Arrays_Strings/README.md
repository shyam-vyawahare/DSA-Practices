# Unit 01: Arrays & Strings

## Overview
This unit focuses on building a strong foundation in **Arrays and Strings**, which are among the most frequently tested topics in technical interviews. The objective is to master **linear traversal, pattern recognition, and optimization techniques** that form the base of advanced Data Structures and Algorithms.

All solutions in this unit are written in **Python** with an interview-oriented approach, prioritizing clarity, optimal complexity, and clean implementation.

---

## Topics Covered
- Array traversal and manipulation
- String traversal and character handling
- Two Pointers technique
- Sliding Window technique
- Prefix Sum technique
- In-place operations and space optimization

---

## Key Patterns Learned
- Index-based traversal
- Two pointers (left–right approach)
- Sliding window (fixed and variable size)
- Hashing-assisted string problems
- Prefix sum for fast range queries
- Greedy decisions in linear arrays

---

## Implemented Problems
- Two Sum
- Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Reverse String
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Prefix Sum (Range Sum Queries)

## Coding Guidelines Followed
- Python-first implementation
- Optimal time and space complexity
- Clear variable naming
- Short problem header in each file:
  - Problem name
  - Technique used
  - Time & space complexity
- No unnecessary shortcuts in the first approach

---

## Learning Outcome
After completing this unit, one should be able to:
- Identify and apply the correct pattern for array and string problems
- Optimize brute-force solutions into linear-time approaches
- Confidently explain logic and complexity during interviews
