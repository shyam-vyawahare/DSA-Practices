# Unit 05: Linked Lists

## Overview
This unit focuses on mastering **Linked Lists**, a fundamental data structure where pointer manipulation and traversal logic are heavily tested in interviews.

---

## Topics Covered
- Singly linked list structure
- Pointer traversal
- Fast & slow pointer technique
- In-place list manipulation
- Dummy node usage

---

## Key Patterns Learned
- Reversing pointers
- Cycle detection
- Middle node identification
- Two-pointer gap technique
- Merging sorted lists

---

## Implemented Problems
- Reverse Linked List
- Detect Cycle in Linked List
- Middle of Linked List
- Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Remove Nth Node From End

## Learning Outcome
After completing this unit, one should be able to:
- Confidently manipulate linked list pointers
- Apply fast–slow pointer patterns
- Solve linked list problems without extra memory
- Explain pointer transitions clearly in interviews
