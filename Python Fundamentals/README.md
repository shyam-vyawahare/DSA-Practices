# Python Fundamentals for DSA

## Overview
This unit focuses on **Python fundamentals required specifically for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. The goal is not to learn Python as a language in depth, but to eliminate syntax friction and build confidence in writing clean, efficient, and interview-ready Python code.

This unit acts as the **foundation layer** for all subsequent DSA units.

## Objectives
By completing this unit, the learner should be able to:
- Write basic Python programs confidently
- Choose appropriate Python data structures for DSA problems
- Understand and analyze time and space complexity
- Grasp recursion fundamentals and the call stack
- Focus on algorithmic thinking without language overhead

---

## Topics Covered
- Python syntax essentials (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Core Python collections:
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
  - Tuples
- Pythonic utilities (`enumerate`, `zip`, comprehensions)
- Recursion basics and call stack understanding
- Time and space complexity (Big-O notation)

## File Descriptions
- **python_collections.py**  
  Covers Python lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples with common operations and their time complexities, focused on DSA usage.

- **recursion_basics.py**  
  Introduces recursion concepts with clear examples, base cases, and common pitfalls.

- **time_complexity_notes.md**  
  Contains notes on Big-O notation, loop analysis, and recursion space complexity.

## Learning Approach
This unit follows a **DSA-first learning approach**, ensuring Python is used as a tool for problem-solving rather than an obstacle. Only concepts directly relevant to algorithmic problem solving are included.

---

## Learning Outcome
After completing this unit, one should be able to:
- Write Python solutions without hesitation
- Explain code logic clearly
- Analyze time and space complexity confidently
- Be fully prepared to start core DSA topics
