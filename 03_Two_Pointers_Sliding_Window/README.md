# Unit 03: Two Pointers & Sliding Window

## Overview
This unit focuses on mastering **Two Pointers** and **Sliding Window** techniques, which are essential for solving array and string problems efficiently in linear time.

---

## Topics Covered
- Two pointers (slow–fast, left–right)
- Fixed-size sliding window
- Variable-size sliding window
- Hash-assisted window tracking
- In-place array manipulation

---

## Key Patterns Learned
- Eliminating nested loops
- Optimizing brute-force solutions
- Maintaining window state dynamically
- Shrinking and expanding windows intelligently

---

## Implemented Problems
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
- Container With Most Water
- Move Zeroes
- Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters
- Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
- Minimum Window Substring
